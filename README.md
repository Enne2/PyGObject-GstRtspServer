# PyGObject-GstRtspServer
#### Simple implementetion of GstRtspServer using Python GObject Introspection
I've found no examples of Gstreamer's RTSP server implementation using GObject Python introspection, so this is a working script deducted from the C examples available at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-rtsp-server.
It could be useful for Rasperry Pi camera stream projects.
Cheers
